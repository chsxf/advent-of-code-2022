# About This Repository

This repository contains the complete source code of my participation to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

All puzzles are solved through PHP.

## Conventions

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for its commit messages.

# Requirements

This source code has only been tested with **PHP 8.1** and is not guaranteed to work on any other version.
# How To Run

Each daily puzzle is stored in its own folder, and each step has its own PHP file.

For example, if you want to run the second puzzle of the third day, proceed as follows from the root folder of the directory:

```sh
cd Day\ 3
php -f day3-2.php
```

## Running With Test Input

Each daily puzzle comes with two data sets: test and full input.

You can run the code using the test input like this:

```sh
php -f day3-2.php -- -test
```
